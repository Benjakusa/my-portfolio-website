                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My journey into the world of technology has been anything but traditional. I originally pursued a degree in biomedical studies because of my deep curiosity about science, health, and the human body. However, even during my academic years, I always found myself drawn to computers, problem-solving, and exploring how digital tools could be applied to improve everyday life. After college, I began training in ICT to formally ground myself in the technical skills I had been informally exploring for years. I quickly discovered that technology was not just a hobby for me—it was a calling. My first steps into the tech industry were as a WordPress developer working under <span>opendesk</span>, where I built and customized websites for individuals and small businesses.</p>
                <p>As my skills grew, so did my ambition. I realized that while WordPress gave me a strong foundation in web development, I wanted to deepen my understanding of programming and software engineering. This led me to enroll in the Full-Stack Software Engineering program at <span>Moringa School</span>. I also enrolled in a Generative AI course with the <span>Open University of Kenya</span>, where I was able to gain in-depth knowledge of artificial intelligence concepts, particularly in areas such as machine learning, natural language processing, and creative AI applications. Today, I see myself as a bridge between creativity and technology—a professional who understands both the human side of innovation and the technical processes that make ideas come to life.</p>
